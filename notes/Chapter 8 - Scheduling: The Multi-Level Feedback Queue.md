The biggest problem of the previous basic policies is that they assume job durations are known beforehand (*priori* knowledge). However, this is hardly true in any real systems. Good scheduling policies tend to learn something from jobs' past behavior (*history*) and make decisions accordingly. One of the best-known approaches is **Multi-Level Feedback Queue** (MLFQ). It tries to trade-off between optimizing turnaround time and minimizing response time. In other words, it well mixes *interactive* or *I/O-intensive* jobs with long-running *CPU-intensive* jobs.

MLFQ has a number of distinct *queues*, each assigned a different **priority** level. A job is in a single queue at any given time.

- Rule 1: If $Priority(A) > Priority(B)$, A runs (B doesnâ€™t).

- Rule 2: If $Priority(A) = Priority(B)$, A & B run in RR.

The key lies in how MLFQ dynamically sets priorities for jobs. MLFQ first assumes that a job might be short-running & interactive, hence giving it highest priority. Then, every time it runs till the end of a time slice without blocking itself on e.g. I/O, we reduce its priority level, moving it to the queue one level down.

- Rule 3: When a job enters, it is placed at the highest priority (the topmost queue);
- Rule 4a: If a job uses up an entire time slice without relinquishing the CPU, it moves down one queue;
- Rule 4b: If a job gives up the CPU before the time slice is up, it stays in the same priority level queue.

There are still a few problems. There might be *starvation* if there are quite a few interactive jobs that a long-running job might have no chance to run. A program could *game* the scheduler by issuing an I/O at the very end of every time slice. The behavior of a job might also change over time. Hence, we add several rules:

- Rule 5: (*Priority boost*) after some time period $S$, move all the jobs in the system to the topmost queue;

- *Gaming tolerance*: once a job uses up its time allotment at a given level (regardless of how many times it has given up the CPU), it moves down one queue.

Smarter MLFQ implementations tune these parameters instead of setting them as a default constant: adjusting #priority levels (#queues), lower levels have longer time slice quanta, using math formula (e.g., decaying) to calculate quanta and allotment, etc. OS implementations, such as FreeBSD, Solaris, and Windows NT, use some form of MLFQ as the base scheduler.
